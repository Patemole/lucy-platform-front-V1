resulting from any compromise of Your systems. You agree that You will be
responsible and liable for payments or transfers containing inaccurate

the Bank&#x27;s limited payment agent. You represent that all payments to Suppliers
are paid to satisfy an obligation you have to the Supplier for goods or services
they provided. Accordingly, payment to Tola shall be considered the same as
payment made directly by you to the Bank. All such payments are held in bank
accounts in the Bank&#x27;s name and owned by the Bank. The account titles of such
accounts also show that these accounts are for the benefit of customers of Tola.
You grant Tola the right to instruct the Bank on the use of funds in the
accounts, including to receive funds from you and to then send funds to your
Suppliers based on your instructions.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Agent of the Payee</strong>. When You use the Payment Service to receive payment from
a Client, You appoint Tola to act as Your agent in connection with the receipt
of funds from Your Client. Receipt of funds from Your Client by Tola will be
deemed to be receipt of funds by You, and will satisfy any payment obligations
of Your Client even if payment is not received by You.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Payment Instructions</strong>. When We receive a payment instruction from a Payer, We
will use commercially reasonable efforts to make and deliver the payment,
subject to this Agreement, and You authorize Us to debit Your Payment Account
and remit funds on Your behalf, all in accordance with the payment instructions.
You agree to be bound by any payment instructions that a Payer provides to Us,
to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Rights We Reserve</strong>. Tola reserves the right to limit or cap or to refuse to
make any payment transaction requested or initiated, for any reason, in Tolaʼs
sole discretion, without any liability to You. By using the Payment Service, You
grant to Us and Tola reserves the right to suspend or cancel any payments
requested or initiated by a Payer, including if Your Tola account is not in good
standing. In the event that We suspend or cancel Your payment, Tola will credit
the amount of any electronic ACH debit(s) received by Us to fund the payment to
Your Payment Account, and You authorize Tola, in its sole discretion, to
withhold and collect from any such credit any Service Fees or other amounts owed
by You to Tola.</p>
<h1><strong class="font-medium">Supplier Management</strong></h1>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Setting Up Your Suppliers</strong>. To use the Payment Service, You will be required
to provide information for Your Suppliers, including for Suppliers that are not
part of the Tola network. For each Supplier, You agree to provide correct and
current information as requested by Tola. By providing, entering, connecting, or
uploading any Supplier information to the Services, You represent and warrant
that You have obtained all necessary authorizations or consents from the
Supplier to share such information. You represent and warrant that the Supplier
agrees, or You have the authority to agree on behalf of the Supplier, to be
subject to and comply with this Agreement and all applicable laws, rules and
regulations. You are solely responsible and Tola is not responsible for
verifying the accuracy of any Supplier information provided in connection with
Your Tola account or use of the Services. Tola is not obligated to determine and
has no obligation to ascertain the bona fides of any dispute raised by the
Supplier with respect to the goods sold or services rendered or otherwise. Tola
will have no liability for losses or damages resulting from the accuracy or
inaccuracy of Your Supplierʼs information, including bank account information,
or Your or Your Supplierʼs actions or inactions. If You invite a Supplier to set
up a Tola account, You acknowledge that it may take several business days to set
up the Supplier in the Services. Tola does not guarantee that a Supplier will be
set up in the Services within any specific time frame.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Payment Instruction Authorizations</strong>. When You create or link a Supplier to
Your Tola account, You authorize Us to follow the payment instructions that We
receive from a Payer to pay that Supplier. In order to process payments more
efficiently and effectively, We may submit check payments to the best known
Supplier address, or alter payment data or data formats for a Supplier, all in
Our sole discretion and without notice to You. Tola reserves the right to refuse
to make payments to any Supplier, in Tolaʼs sole discretion.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Payment Method</strong>. To use the Payment Service, for each payment transaction,
You must choose a payment method to pay Your Supplier. Available payment methods
may include electronic ACH payment, wire payment, check payment, card payment,
Pay Later, and AR factoring. The payment method selected may be governed by
additional terms in this Agreement and/or in a separate agreement. Tola reserves
the right to change or limit the payment method options available to any Payer
or Supplier, or to select the method by which a payment transaction will be
made, all in Tolaʼs sole discretion. All payments shall be in US Dollars or as
otherwise acceptable to Tola in writing.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Process Dates</strong>. Payment transactions made through the Payment Service require
sufficient time for Tola to debit Your Payment Account and for Your Supplier to
receive payment. When making a payment through the Payment Service, You must
select an available date (&quot;<strong class="font-medium">Process Date</strong>&quot;) on which the ACH debit will be
processed from Your Payment Account to fund the payment. You agree that You are
solely responsible for scheduling payments and selecting an appropriate Process
Date for each payment transaction. You understand that the selection of a future
Process Date may not be available for all products and services.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">No Warranty or Representation</strong>. When provided by Tola, estimated payment
dates are for convenience only, and Tola does not guarantee that a payment to a
Supplier will be made within any specific time frame of the Process Date, and
Tola disclaims any responsibility or liability if a payment scheduled through
the Pay Service is not made to a Supplier on or before any specific date. It is
Your sole responsibility to ensure that payment to a Supplier is made as
required by agreement, contract or law. Except as otherwise agreed or required
by law, You will be solely responsible and Tola will not be responsible for all
penalties, interest charges, and other late payment fees associated with
payments that are delivered after their due date.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Payment Cancellation</strong>. You understand and agree that when You authorize a
payment to be made to a Supplier through the Services, Your authorization
remains in effect for up to thirty (30) days. Payments that are scheduled but
have not yet begun to be processed may be canceled and, if a change is needed,
reissued, through Your Tola account. Once Tola has begun to process a payment,
the payment cannot be canceled, and You must request to void the payment. The
foregoing is subject to the Void Payment Requests provisions below.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Void Payment Requests</strong>. To stop a payment after it has begun to process, You
must request to void the payment through the Services. If You submit a Void
Payment Request, Tola will use commercially reasonable efforts to stop the
payment, but You understand and agree that Tola may not be able to stop the
payment. Tolaʼs ability to stop a payment depends on a number of factors,
including but not limited to the payment method and whether the payment has
cleared the Supplierʼs account. You agree that Tola will not have any liability
for failing to stop a payment that has begun to process. A Void Payment Request
may be subject to a Service fee.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Rights We Reserve</strong>. Tola reserves the right to expire, void, or cancel any
payment if the payment is not deposited or otherwise received and processed by a
Supplier within a reasonable amount of time, as determined in Tolaʼs sole
discretion. If We expire, void or cancel any payment, You authorize and We will
credit the amount of the payment to Your Payment Account, less any Service Fees
or other amounts owed by You to Tola.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Returned Transactions</strong>. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the
payment information or the payment instructions provided to Tola. If a payment
is refused or returned, Tola will void the payment, unless Tola in its sole
discretion agrees to take other action on the payment such as crediting or
reissuing the payment. If a returned or refused payment is voided, You authorize
Tola to credit the amount of the payment to Your Payment Account, less any
Service Fees or other amounts owed by You to Tola.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Fraudulent Transactions:</strong> Tola holds Customers accountable for their
Suppliers. To the extent allowed by law, You agree that You will be liable for
all losses or payments resulting from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized
interaction with one of Your Suppliers, particularly in cases of fraud, if a
Supplier is later found to be fraudulent, or information provided to Tola about
the Supplier was inaccurate or misrepresented, intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Document Management</strong>. You may upload invoices, bills, statements of accounts
from Suppliers, or other documents (&quot;<strong class="font-medium">Bills</strong>&quot;) to the Inbox of Your Tola
account. You may also authorize Suppliers to send electronic Bills to Your Tola
account, or You can create Bills using the Services. You are solely responsible
for the Bills uploaded, created, recorded, processed, approved, paid, and/or
synced or shared with third parties through Your Tola account. Tola is not
responsible for any Bills, including those that are misdirected or not received.</p>

<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">Each provision of this Agreement that provides for a limitation of liability,
disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is intended to and does
allocate the risks between the parties under this Agreement. Each of these
provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of this
Agreement. All limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranties, and
exclusions of consequential damages or other damages or remedies will remain
fully valid, effective and enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, even under circumstances that cause an exclusive remedy to fail of its
essential purpose. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
OF DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR CERTAIN WARRANTIES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY.</p>
<h1><strong class="font-medium">Indemnification</strong></h1>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">You agree to full liability and responsibility for Your use of the Services, and
You will defend and indemnify the Tola Parties and their officers, directors,
employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents from and against
every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable
attorneys&#x27; fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) Your
violation of any portion of this Agreement, or any applicable law or regulation;
(b) Your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property
right, or publicity, confidentiality, other property or privacy right; or (c)
any dispute or issue between You and any third party. We reserve the right, at
Our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
otherwise subject to indemnification by You (without limiting Your
indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, You
agree to cooperate with Our defense of that claim.</p>
<h1><strong class="font-medium">Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></h1>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>. In the interest of resolving disputes between You
and the Tola Parties in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, You and
Tola agree that every dispute arising in connection with this Agreement against
the Tole Parties will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less
formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of
a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be
subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages
and relief that a court can award. The Agreement to Arbitrate disputes includes
all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether
based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination
of this Agreement. <strong class="font-medium">BY ENTERING IN THIS</strong></p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">AGREEMENT, YOU AND TOLA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO FILE A</strong></p>

ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</strong></p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Waiver of Class Actions and Right to Trial by Jury</strong>. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, You acknowledge and agree that You may bring claims against
the Tola Parties only in Your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or
class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. <strong class="font-medium">CLASS

WAIVED YOUR RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND TO A TRIAL BY JURY</strong>.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Procedures</strong>. Any arbitration between You and Tola will be settled under the</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">Procedures (collectively, &quot;<strong class="font-medium">AAA Rules</strong>ˮ) of the American Arbitration
Association</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">(&quot;<strong class="font-medium">AAA</strong>ˮ), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" class="text-balance text-subheadline font-normal rounded-sm text-foreground underline decoration-1 underline-offset-2 outline-none focus-visible:bg-surface focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-foreground focus-visible:ring-offset-2">www.adr.org.</a> The
arbitration process shall be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and not by a
panel.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Notice</strong>. If You intend to seek arbitration, You must first send a written
notice</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">(&quot;<strong class="font-medium">Notice</strong>ˮ) of Your claim or dispute to Tola by certified U.S. Mail or by
Federal Express (signature required). Tola address for Notice is Tolaʼs address
of record as listed on the Tola Website, ATTN LEGAL. The Notice must describe:
(a) the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) the remedy that You
want</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">(&quot;<strong class="font-medium">Demand</strong>ˮ). You and Tola agree to make good faith efforts to resolve the
claim directly, but if You and Tola do not reach an agreement within 60 days
after the Notice is received, You or Tola may commence an arbitration
proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
You or Tola must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
makes a final decision and award, if any.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Fees</strong>. If You commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, the
payment of fees related to the arbitration will be decided by the AAA Rules. If
Your claim is less than ten thousand dollars  $10,000.00, Tola will reimburse
You for the payment of the filing fee. However, if the arbitrator finds that
either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set
forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), You agree to reimburse Tola for
any fees paid on Your behalf that would otherwise be Your obligation under the
AAA Rules.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Location</strong>. The arbitration hearing will take place at a location selected by
Tola in San Francisco County, California. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less,
You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the
basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance
based telephone hearing or electronic (e.g. Zoom, Teams, WebEx, Court Call); or
(c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in San Francisco
County, California.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Severability</strong>. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this
Agreement. If this Agreement to Arbitrate is found to be, in whole or in part,
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain
in effect.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>. Nothing in this Agreement will be
deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right to: (a) bring an
individual (nonclass, non-representative) action in small claims court so long
as such action remains in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action
through the applicable federal, state, or local agency, if that action is
available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in
a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
<h1><strong class="font-medium">Governing Law</strong></h1>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty">This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
including any disputes between You and Tola, will be governed by the laws of the
State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. To the
extent that any dispute or action relating to this Agreement is permitted to be
brought in a court of law, You agree that the legal action or proceeding will be
brought exclusively in the state courts located in San Francisco County,
California. You and Tola agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of and
agree that venue is proper in the state courts located in San Francisco County,

Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.</p>
<h1><strong class="font-medium">Other Provisions</strong></h1>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Force Majeure</strong>. Tola will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform
any obligation related to the Services if the delay or failure is due to
unforeseen events that are beyond Tolaʼs reasonable control, such as war,
strikes, blockade, terrorism, riots, epidemic, natural disasters or governmental
action. Force Majeure is never a defense or excuse for nonpayment.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Waiver</strong>. The waiver of any default or breach of this Agreement will not
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. Except as
otherwise stated in this Agreement, the exercise of any remedy under this
Agreement will be without prejudice to other remedies available under this
Agreement or otherwise.</p>
<p class="text-subheadline font-normal max-w-prose text-pretty"><strong class="font-medium">Compliance with Laws</strong>. You and Tola each agree to comply with all applicable
laws and regulations with respect to the Services and Your use of the Service,

relating to the Services, at any time, in Our sole discretion. Tola will post
revised Terms or policies on Our Website, and will provide notice to You of
material changes to this Agreement. You will be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to any revisions or changes to this Agreement at the time of (i) Your
electronic acceptance of the revised, changed or new Agreement, or (ii) Your use
of the Services after the effective date of the revised, changed or new
Agreement. If the revised, changed or new Agreement is not acceptable to You,
Your sole and exclusive remedy will be to stop using the Services and/or to
cancel Your account.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="grid w-full bg-surface-muted pt-6 pb-16 md:pt-8 md:pb-24"><div class="grid-bleed auto-rows-auto gap-y-12 justify-self-center
